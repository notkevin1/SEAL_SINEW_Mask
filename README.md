# SEAL - SINEW Mask Power Electronics Software

This repository contains files used in Arduino-based devices which control the power supply parameters such as frequency, duty cycle, and burst ratio. One version is designed for the [Arduino Nano](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano/) (non-BLE, non-WiFi), and other for the [Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Arduino-Microcontroller-SAMD21-Cortex-M0+-p-4426.html).  

Note the steps required to push onto this branch:
```
git init
git add "filename" (or git add . to add all files in folder)
git commit -m "message for commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/notkevin1/SEAL_SINEW_Mask.git
git push -u origin main
```
